# Background

Process

- identify the signals that indicated the need for this research
- describe relevant previous research
- list the anticipated insights to be gained

Write a few sentences that answer why the research is being conducted.

{what is being produced} {the problem it is addressing} {what research question is being asked}

**Example**

> We are producing a dumbbell that helps motivate cats to lift more weight. We want to determine if a dumbbell that counts out loud number of cakes as reps motivates cats to continue lifting.

# Goals

Set goals that answer questions such as

- what design problems are you solving for
- how will the research results impact design decisions

**Example**

> Is the dumbbell message motivating to the user.

# Research Questions

What are the specific and measurable questions the study is investigating.
What can be learnt from the study.

Questions should be

- measurable
- specific
- non leading

**Example**

> Do cats that use the talking dumbbell continue lifting more or less or at the same rate than cats that don't use a talking dumbbell.

# Metrics

Metrics are the actual values to be considered.

**Example**

> Longitudinal difference in mean lifting sessions between talking dumbbell group and non talking dumbbell group.

You will also need to align the research metrics and results with the organizations KPIs.

Some examples of KPIs

- conversion rate : task completed successfully
- drop off rate : exit before completing task
- system usability scale : questionnaire
- time on task : duration
- use of navigation vs use of search : number of users
- user error rate : a low error rate does not necessarily indicate a good ux

# Methods

Explain how the research will be conducted.

- how will data be collected
- how will data be analyzed

**Example**

> Have users document the number of sessions they complete over 1 month. Survey users weekly to self report their motivation to continue lifting.
> Use stat software to determine group differences. Use table to categorize and tabulate survey responses.

# Participants

Describe study participants.

- demographics
- characteristics
- inclusion criteria
- exclusion criteria
- screening survey
- compensation

Ensure that your sample is large enough and representative of the diverse user base.

**Example**

> Cats that like cakes but are not obsessed with cakes while not being underweight or overweight and not being bodybuilders.

# Script

The specific instructions to be given to participants or the specific questions to ask the participants.

## Instructions

 - welcome participant
 - thank participant for their time
 - ask and record their consent
 - obtain basic demographic info
 - remind participant that it is not a test , no right or wrong answers
 - ask if they have any questions
## Tasks

- specific
- relevant to research goals
- lead to participant action
- do not provide clues on how to complete the task

**Example**

> Please write down the number of sessions you completed at the end of each day with this app. And answer the questions at the end of a given week on that Friday.

## Conclude

- ask any clarifying questions
- end recording and session
- thank participant
