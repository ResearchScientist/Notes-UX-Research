# Interviews

Duration : 1 hour
Members : 1 interviewer, 1 interviewee
Data : recorded conversation, transcripts, notes

Structured : scripted interview
allows for consistency

Semi Structured : few prepared questions
allows for interview to flow in a general direction with the ability for the interviewer to dive deeper into certain aspects with open ended questions

Unstructured : no script only a general list of topics
allows for a more relaxed conversation style in which the interviewer can guide and explore as needed

# Focus Groups

Duration : 1.5 hours
Members : 1 facilitator, 5 to 10 users, stakeholders behind a one way mirror
Data : recorded conversation, transcripts, notes

Facilitator can leverage group think to surface creative insights from the members.

Agenda

**10 min** Introduction & warm up questions
**10 min** Stimulating activity for engagement
**60 min** Main topics
**10 min** Conclusion

# Naturalistic Observations

Observing users within their environment and context.

Make sure to
- explain scope
- document user permissions
- anonymize user data

Observer may be unable to obtain direct user feedback during the observation so be aware of biases and assumptions when taking notes about user actions.

# Surveys

Can contain both open ended and closed ended questions.

Closed ended questions can be used for quantifying user responses for statistical analysis.

Make sure to
- pretest the survey
## Uses

- Same survey can be administered in a cyclic schedule thus providing data about user patterns over time.
- Stand alone surveys can be used to validate initial insights.

## Scales

For closed ended questions that ask for a user to respond with a rating there are many scales.

- NPS : net promoter score (1 to 10)
	- How likely are you to recommend this product
	- promoters 9 to10
	- detractors 0 to 6
- SUS : system usability scale (1 highly disagree to 5 highly agree)
	- I found it easy to use.
	- I found it to be complex.
	- score converted to 0 to 100
	- some questions are inverted
- CSAT : customer satisfaction scale (1 very unsatisfied to 5 very satisfied)
	- How satisfied are you overall with the app

Other concepts that can be tested with other scales include

- Ease of Use
- Trust
- Attitute
- Intention To Use

# Experiments

Used for testing a hypothesis.

- vary only one variable per experiment

# Behavioural

Measures

- task success : binary (success, fail) or by levels (success,  fail, abandon, time exceeded)
- time on task : duration
- error : number of errors
- efficiency : relative to optimal path
- learnability : time and effort required to reach high proficiency

# Psychophysiological

Physiological measures used for gaining insights into a user's mental state.

## Attention

**Eye Tracking**

- fixations : gaze stops on object for 100 ms to 300 ms
- saccades : movement between fixations
- data viz : gaze plots, heatmaps, opacity maps
- area of interest (aoi) : region research question is focused on
- metrics : measures
	- dwell time : gaze duration on aoi
	- visits : number of times aoi was fixated or % of time on aoi vs entire stimulus
	- first fixation time : duration leading to initial aoi visit

## Cognition

Information Processing

**Cognitive Effort**

- pupil dilation : dilate with increased attention, cognitive load, arousal
- fMRI ; low temporal resolution , high spatial resolution
- EEG : high temporal resolution, low spatial resolution

|Hz|Frequency|State|
|--|--|--|
|> 30|Gamma|active information processing, emotion|
|13 to 30|Beta|alert and attentive|
|8 to 12|Alpha|relaxed, awake and eyes closed|
|4 to 8|Theta|short term memory task, internal focus, meditation|
|< 4|Delta|deep sleep|

## Emotion

**Universal Emotions**

- anger
- disgust
- fear
- happiness
- sadness
- surprise

arousal : emotional intensity
valence : negative to positive spectrum from unpleasant to pleasant

**Arousal Measures**

- blood pressure
- electrodermal activity
- eeg
- heart rate

**Valence Measures**

- eeg
- facial analysis software and expression recognition
- facial electromyography


# Types & Uses

|Type|When|Duration|Questions|Outcomes|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Exploratory Interview|design|60 min|open ended|reveal user's mental model and motivations|
|Contextual Interview|user testing|10 min|semi open|validate  user test observations|

|Phone Survey|user experience|10 min|closed ended, scaled|reveal user experience|

# Process

- write hypothesis
- list your assumptions
- write an interview guide
- set up space
