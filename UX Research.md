UX Research occurs throughout the product development lifecycle.

# Research Categories
## Foundational Research

Occurs prior to the design phase.
Can also be called strategic or generative.

### Goal

To define the problem.

Answer the following questions

- what are the user problems
- how can we solve them
- what should we build

### Strategies

- user interviews

## Design Research

Occurs during the design phase.
Can also be called tactical.

### Goal

To inform on the design.

Answers the following question

- how should we build it
- what are the friction points the user encounters during the prototyping
- how can we remove those friction points

### Strategies

- user interviews
	- how was your prototype experience
	- was it easy to use why
	- did you encounter any challenges

## Post Launch Research

Occurs after the design phase.

### Goal

To evaluate how well a product is meeting the user needs.

Answers the question

- did we succeed

### Strategies

- interviews

# Methods

- a/b test : test alternate designs
- card sort : user organizes items to expose user's mental model
- clickstream analytics : sequence of pages visited
- concept testing : concept explained to users for feedback
- contextual inquiry : collaborative field study between user and researcher
- desirability study : match designs with attributes
- diary study : longitudinal use
- ethnographic study / field study : observe within natural context
- eye tracking : focus areas
- feedback : users volunteer information
- first click test : user stopped after clicking
- five second test : visual removed after 5s and user asked to describe what they say
- focus group : moderated discussion or activity
- formative : methods that determine if a design works or not and why , informs iterations
- interview : individually gather opinions, thoughts, experiences, feelings
- moderated : researcher led interaction, can be remote
- multivariate : multiple combinations of design elements tested simultaneously
- participatory design : users are given elements to construct their ideal experience
- retrospective think aloud : users express their thoughts after completing a task
- summative : methods that assess overall usability , summarize final design
- survey : same questions given to many respondents
- think aloud : user expresses their thoughts and motivations as they interact
- tree test : tests ease of information architecture
- unmoderated : automated interaction through an app or site
- usability benchmark : determine baseline through well defined measures
- usability test : user completes a series of tasks
- web analytics : clicks page views etc

# Biases

Types of biases and how to overcome them.

- confirmation bias : looking for evidence to prove a held hypothesis
	- actively listen
	- ask open ended questions
	- large diverse n
	- consistent interview method
- false consensus bias : overestimation of n who agree with us
	- identify and articulate your assumptions
	- large diverse n
	- consistent interview method
- friendliness bias : agree with someone they like
	- ask for honest feedback
- implicit bias : attitudes and stereotypes attributed to others without our awareness
	- reflect on our behaviours
	- ask others to point out our biases
- primacy bias : memory of first encounter is strongest
	- make a recording
	- take detailed notes
	- consistent interview method
- recency bias : easier to remember the last thing encountered
	- make a recording
	- take detailed notes
	- consistent interview method
- social desirability bias : answers are given in a way to be viewed favorably, positive bias
	- present a list of responses from other users and ask which response to they most closely agree with
- sunk cost fallacy : the more invested into a project the more difficult to change
	- break project into phases
	- outline evaluation points where you can decide to continue or stop

# Pain Points

Categories for user struggles.

- financial : such as a paywall
- product : the delivered feature itself is flawed
- process : user flow is interrupted
- service : user needs assistance but cs or onboarding is not adequate

# Edge Cases

Identify by

- making personas
- making user stories
- making wireframes
- thoroughly reviewing the product prior to launch

# Methods

Example of methods per phase.
It is not necessary to use each method. Only use what is appropriate for the project.
